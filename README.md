# ANSIBLE MQTT PYTHON BROKER

Ansible script to install a MQTT Broker.

## cred.conf

Make a file called /cred.conf with your username and a SHA-512 hash of your password. This hash can be generated by using the command in Ubuntu
```
mkpasswd -m sha-512
```

For OEL9 Use 
```
openssl passwd -6 '<PASSWORD>'
```

The format should look like
```
<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>
```

Ensure this file in the / directory.

## mqtt.conf
Move the mqtt.conf file to /mqtt.conf

## Execute the startup.sh

This will run the Broker in the background.
```
./startup.sh
```
